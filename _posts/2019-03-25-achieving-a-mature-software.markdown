Hi guys, I'm here to announce my first book (e-book) which has focus on low-experienced developers or devs stuck on time (devs that stopped to evolve). The book, **Achieving A Mature Software**, costs **nothing** (yes, it's free =P). The whole idea is to show a little from what exists on programming's world, where you can get, introduce various concepts and tips to improve software qualityâ€¦ So if you know someone with these characteristics or just want to read, here are the links:
